This project is a full-stack Farming Chatbot application developed to assist users, particularly farmers, in obtaining reliable information on agricultural topics. The system includes a React-based frontend with user authentication (login and signup), and a backend built with FastAPI that processes user queries. The backend uses a structured farming knowledge dataset to generate appropriate responses. The application communicates via REST APIs and handles user interactions through a simple and intuitive chatbot interface. It is designed with a modular architecture, separating frontend and backend functionality for better scalability and maintenance. The project uses MySQL for data storage and demonstrates practical implementation of full-stack development principles in a real-world context.
